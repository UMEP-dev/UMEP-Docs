* Introduction
    **TARGET** (The Air-temperature Response to Green blue-infrastructure Evaluaition Tool) is a simple modelling framework used to examine intra urban climate (10\ :sup:`2` m resolution). It has specifically been developed as an efficient, easy-to-use model albe to investigate heat mitigation effects of green and blue infrastructure within urban areas but can also be used to model the canopy urban heat island (`Broadbent et al. 2019) <https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/12/785/2019/>`__  

    The **TARGET Analyser** plugin can be used to make basic spatial analysis and plot model results generated by the `TARGET <TARGET>` plugin in `UMEP for processing <UMEPforProcessing>`. This plugin is availabe both from `UMEP for processing <UMEPforProcessing>` and the regular menu-based UMEP plugin. The plotting capabilities are only available in the latter.

      * - Path to TARGET Run name folder
        - This was set when running TARGET from the Processor.
      * - Examine single night
        - Tick this in if you want to examine air temperature variations for a specific night. 
      * - Month and day when single night begins
        - Specify the single date that should be examined. The nocturnal hours from following day will be included. The date specified must be within the days modelled in `TARGET <TARGET>`.
      * - Statistic measure
        - Choose how Ta differences between forcing data and modelled data should be represented, e.g. mean, max etc.
      * - Time of day
        - Specify when times that should be included in the staistical calculation above.
      * - Vector polygon grid
        - The vectory polygon grid that depicts the modelling area(s). This should be the same polygon layer that was used in `TARGETPrepare <TARGETPrepare>` and `TARGET <TARGET>`.
      * - ID field
        - Choose the attribute from the selected polygon layer that was used to separate the different polygon objects from each other in `TARGETPrepare <TARGETPrepare>` and `TARGET <TARGET>`.
      * - Polygon grid irregular (not squared)
        - Tick this in if a grid is irregular i.e. not squared and aligned north to south.
      * - Pixel resolution (m)
        - When a irregular grid is used, a pixel resolution in meters must be specified.
      * - Add results to vector polygon grid attribute table
        - Tick this in if you like to add UHI statistics in the attribute table of your polygon grid
      * - Output raster from statistical analysis
        - Specify the location of the geotiff that will be created from the analysis
      * - Open output file after runing algorithm
        - The geotiff generated will be added to your QGIS project

* Run
    Starts the algorithm. 

* Help
    Link to this manual page.

* Close
    Closes the plugin.

* Remarks
      - This is a very simple tool for generating spatial information from the TARGET model.
      - In the menu-based UMEP tool there is also possibility to plot time series of air temperature differences for specific grids as well as specify specific days to examine.
