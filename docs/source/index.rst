The Urban Multi-scale Environmental Predictor (**UMEP**) is a climate
service tool, designed for researchers and service providers (e.g.
architects, climatologists, energy, health and urban planners) presented as a plugin for `QGIS <http://qgis.org>`__. This
tool can be used for a variety of applications related to outdoor
thermal comfort, urban energy consumption, climate change mitigation
etc. **UMEP** consists of a coupled modelling system which combines
“state of the art” 1D and 2D models related to the processes essential
for scale independent urban climate estimations.

   Source area modelling with UMEP

**UMEP** is open source, where users can contribute as well as extend the tool
to improve modelling capabilities. A major feature is the ability for a user to interact with spatial
information to determine model parameters. The spatial data across a
range of scales and sources are accessed through
`QGIS <http://qgis.org>`__ - a cross-platform, free, open source
desktop geographic information systems application –
that provides data viewing, editing, and analysis capabilities.
