* Introduction
     The Morphometric Calculator (Grid) pre-processor calculates various morphometric parameters based on digital surface models.


* Dialog box

            :align: center

            The dialog for the Morphometric Calculator (Grid)

* Dialog sections
   .. list-table::
      :widths: 10 90
      :header-rows: 0

      * - upper
        - Specifies the area of interest where the morphometric parameters are calculated. Set the search interval in degrees and from where the search should take place within each gri
      * - middle
        - Specifies the input data regarding 3D objects and ground as well as specifying what grid that should be used.
      * - lower
        - Specifies output and runs the calculations.

* Search Throughout the Grid Extent
     Select if the search should be performed from one side of the grid to the opposite side.
     Select the other option (Search from Grid Centroid if the search should start from the centroid of the grid. Setting the **Search distance** can then allow for the search to extent beyond the grid. See the figure below for illustration. The left one performs a search using the grid extent whereas the right illustrates a search from the centroid and extending outside of the grid.

        The two search methods for the Search Throughout the Grid Extent option

* Wind Direction Search Interval (degrees)
     This decides the interval in search directions for which the morphometric parameters will be calculated.

* Vector Polygon Grid
     Here the grid polygon layer should be specified.

* ID Field
     Choose an attribute from the selected polygon layer that will be used to separated the different polygon objects from each other. An attribute field of unique numbers or letters should be used.

* Add results to polygon grid
     Tick this in if you would like to save a isotropic results in the attribute table for your polygon vector grid.

* Raster DSM (only 3D Objects) Exist
     Tick this in if a 3D-object DSM without ground heights is available. 3D objects (e.g. buildings) should be metres above ground.

* Raster DSM (3D Objects and Ground)
     A raster DSM (e.g. geoTIFF) consisting of ground and e.g. building height (metres above sea level).

* Raster DEM (only Ground)
     A DEM (e.g. geoTIFF) consisting of pixels with ground heights (metres above sea level).

* Raster DSM (only 3D Objects)
     A DSM (e.g. geoTIFF) consisting of pixels with object (e.g. buildings or vegetation) heights above ground. Pixels where no objects are present should be set to zero.

* Roughness calculation Method
     Options to choose methods for roughness calculations regarding zero-plane displacement height (zd) and roughness length (z0) are available.

* File Prefix
     A prefix that will be included in the beginning of the output files.

* Ignore NoData pixels
     Tick this in if NoData pixels should be ignored and calculation of grid should be performed eventhough NoData pixels exists within that grid. Nodata pixels are set to the average pixel values of the DEM.

* Output Folder
     A specified folder where result will be saved.

* Run
     Starts the calculations

* Close
     Closes the plugin

* Output
     Two different files are saved after a successful run.
     
     #. **Anisotropic** result where the morphometric parameters for each wind direction as selected are included.
     #. **Isotropic** results where all directions are integrated into one value for each parameter.

* Remarks
      All DSMs need to have the same extent and pixel size.
      Polygon grids must be squared (or rectangular) and allinged with the CRS used. This will be fixed in future versions so that any shaped grid can be used (see issue #12 in the `repository <https://github.com/UMEP-dev/UMEP/issues>`__).
