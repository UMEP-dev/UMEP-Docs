* Introduction:
    The SUEWS Database Manager is a tool that can be used to add new input parameters used for the SUEWS model, which is one of the main models incorporated in UMEP. The purpose of creating this new genration of database connected to SUEWS is to reduce redundancies present in the old input text-files and to make easier for users to investigate and change input information to the model. Furthermore, the ambition of this open database is to imporove general input infromation for all SUEWS-users. Apart for facilitating specific input variables, users can also use this plugin to create so-called urban typologies which represents certain properties for specific urban neigborhoods. These typologies can in turn be used to produce input data for SUEWS using the `SUEWS Database Prepare <SUEWSDatabasePrepare>` plugin.

    The plugin consist of 11 different tabs used to access and add info to the database. Most tabs has two purposes. First, you can use it to create new entries in the database and second, you can use it to examine allready existing data stored in the database.
    
    If you have made any changes, please save the database and consider to submit this back to the developers so that the database can be updated and redistributed to other users. Currently we have no automatic system for this so save the excel file and send to *fredrikl[at]gvc.gu.se*.

      * - Tab name
        - Description
      * - Main tab - Reclassifier
        - Used for classification of typology vector data from any urban classes to SUEWS defined urban typologies.
      * - Typologies
        - Here, new urban typologies can be created. Currently, description of *buildings* and *paved* land cover classes are included in a typology.
      * - Land Cover
        - Here, new land cover classes is created. Each land cover type have different input parameters that should be specified. Here, you can also get info on the different parameter settings availalbe for each parameter type.
      * - Parameters
        - All environmental parameters is gathered in this tab. Here new values can be added for each specific parameter
      * - Emissions
        - Anthropogenic emission parameters can be added here. See help section in the SUEWS model on how to set these.
      * - Profiles
        - There are different types of activity profiles used in SUEWS. They are all gathered in this tab. This plugin has imported country-specific profile from the LUCY-model `(Allen et al. 2010) <https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/joc.2210>`__ that can be used. You can also create your own profiles.
      * - Irrigation 
        - Hydrology is one main feature in SUEWS. In this tab one can set specific parameters related to irrigation
      * - Snow 
        - A specific module within SUEWS can also model the effect of snow on water and energy balance. This tab sets various parameters related to this module.
      * - Building facets 
        - SUEWS have capabilities to estimate radiation and storage fluxes via the SPARTACUS-model (still experimental) and the ESTM-scheme. Properties of building facts are added in this tab.  
      * - Building Materials 
        - Here building materials is added to the database.
      * - References 
        - It is essential to be able to know the source of information for each parameter added. This tab is used to add new references into the database.
