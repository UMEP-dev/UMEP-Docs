The Urban Multi-scale Environmental Predictor (**UMEP**) is a climate
service tool, designed for researchers and service providers (e.g.
architects, climatologists, energy, health and urban planners). This
tool can be used for a variety of applications related to outdoor
thermal comfort, urban energy consumption, climate change mitigation
etc. **UMEP** consists of a coupled modelling system which combines
“state of the art” 1D and 2D models related to the processes essential
for scale independent urban climate estimations.

   Source area modelling with UMEP

**UMEP** is a open source model, where users can contribute as well as extend the tool
to improve modelling capabilities. It is freely available for download.
A major feature is the ability for a user to interact with spatial
information to determine model parameters. The spatial data across a
range of scales and sources are accessed through
`QGIS <http://qgis.org>`__ - a cross-platform, free, open source
desktop geographic information systems
(`GIS <Abbreviations>`) application –
that provides data viewing, editing, and analysis capabilities.

.. note:: The porting of UMEP into QGIS3 is almost ready (beta version) but require more testing. In the meantime, UMEP is still availabe for QGIS (2.18.x).

We are keen to get inputs and contributions from others. Plesae contribute in the following ways:

#. Submit comments or report issues about the UMEP plugin to the code `repository <https://bitbucket.org/fredrik_ucg/umep/issues>`__.
#. Participate in `coding or adding new features <How_to_Contribute>`.
#. Contribute by writing `tutorials and guidelines <https://tutorial-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ for other users to give examples of the many application possibilities of UMEP.
#. Submit comments or report issues about the UMEP manual `here <https://github.com/Urban-Meteorology-Reading/UMEP-Docs/issues>`__.
