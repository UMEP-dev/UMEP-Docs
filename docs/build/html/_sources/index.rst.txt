UMEP Manual
-----------

The Urban Multi-scale Environmental Predictor (**UMEP**) is a climate
service tool, designed for researchers and service providers (e.g.
architects, climatologists, energy, health and urban planners). This
tool can be used for a variety of applications related to outdoor
thermal comfort, urban energy consumption, climate change mitigation
etc. **UMEP** consists of a coupled modelling system which combines
“state of the art” 1D and 2D models related to the processes essential
for scale independent urban climate estimations.

   Source area modelling with UMEP

**UMEP** is a open source model, where users can contribute as well as extend the tool
to improve modelling capabilities. It is freely available for download.
A major feature is the ability for a user to interact with spatial
information to determine model parameters. The spatial data across a
range of scales and sources are accessed through
`QGIS <http://qgis.org>`__ - a cross-platform, free, open source
desktop geographic information systems
(`GIS <http://urban-climate.net/umep/Abbreviations>`__) application –
that provides data viewing, editing, and analysis capabilities.

This software is in continuous development. There are two types of
releases:

#. *Long term release* - this may be obtained from the QGIS plugin
   manager `(see
   details) <http://www.urban-climate.net/umep/UMEP_Manual#Getting_Started>`__.
#. *Current development version* - this can be obtained from the plugin
   `repository <http://www.bitbucket.org/fredrik_ucg/umep>`__. This
   version you need to manually install yourself `(see
   details) <http://www.urban-climate.net/umep/UMEP_Manual#Getting_Started>`__.

The UMEP plugin consist of three
parts; a pre-processor, a processor and a post-processor. The
pre-processor prepares spatial and meteorological data as inputs to the
modelling system. The processor includes all the main models for the
main calculations. To provide initial “quick looks” the post-processor
will enable results to be plotted, statistics calculated etc. based on
the model output. For more information on the content and archetecture,
see `Plugin
Architecture <http://urban-climate.net/umep/UMEP_Manual#Tool_Architecture>`__.

\ **PLEASE NOTICE!**\

Due to a recent update of **netCDF4** library (1.3.0), the **netCDF4**
library has a version conflict related to the **numpy** version
currently used in QGIS 2.18.x. This results in that some plugins in UMEP
will fail, e.g. LQf.

We have submitted an issue regarding this to the QGIS community.
Meanwhile, we recommend UMEP users to downgrade the netCDF4 library to
**1.2.9**. This is easiest done by opening the **OSGeo4W shell** and run
the two following commands::
    pip uninstall netCDF4
    pip install netCDF4==1.2.9

--------------

UMEP is an an *open source tool*. We are keen to get inputs and
contributions from others. There are two main ways to contribute:

#. Submit comments or issues to the
   `repository <https://bitbucket.org/fredrik_ucg/umep/issues>`__
#. Participate in `Coding or adding new
   features <http://urban-climate.net/umep/DevelopmentGuidelines>`__.

It is also possible to contribute by writing `tutorials and
guidelines <http://urban-climate.net/umep/UMEP_Manual#Tutorials>`__ for
other users to give examples of the many application possibilities of UMEP.
