UMEP Manual
-----------

The Urban Multi-scale Environmental Predictor (**UMEP**) is a climate
service tool, designed for researchers and service providers (e.g.
architects, climatologists, energy, health and urban planners). This
tool can be used for a variety of applications related to outdoor
thermal comfort, urban energy consumption, climate change mitigation
etc. **UMEP** consists of a coupled modelling system which combines
“state of the art” 1D and 2D models related to the processes essential
for scale independent urban climate estimations.

   Source area modelling with UMEP

**UMEP** is a open source model, where users can contribute as well as extend the tool
to improve modelling capabilities. It is freely available for download.
A major feature is the ability for a user to interact with spatial
information to determine model parameters. The spatial data across a
range of scales and sources are accessed through
`QGIS <http://qgis.org>`__ - a cross-platform, free, open source
desktop geographic information systems
(`GIS <Abbreviations>`) application –
that provides data viewing, editing, and analysis capabilities.

.. note:: The migration of UMEP into QGIS3 is planned for the Autumn of 2018. In the meantime, use UMEP with the LTR version of QGIS (2.18.x).

We are keen to get inputs and contributions from others. There are two main ways to contribute:

#. Submit comments or issues to the
   `repository <https://bitbucket.org/fredrik_ucg/umep/issues>`__
#. Participate in `coding or adding new features <How_to_Contribute>`.
#. Contribute by writing `tutorials and guidelines <Tutorials/Tutorials>` for other users to give examples of the many application possibilities of UMEP.
