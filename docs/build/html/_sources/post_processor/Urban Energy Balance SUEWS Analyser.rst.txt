* Introduction
    The **SUEWS Analyzer** plugin can be used to make basic analysis of model results generated by the *SUEWS Simple* and *SUEWS Advanced* plugins.

      * - top
        - Model results to be analyzer is specified.
      * - left
        - Plotting of time series derived from Points of Interest during model calculations in SUEWS
      * - bottom
        - Analysis of spatial results from model calculations in SUEWS

Load model result
    A namelist (*RunControl.nml*) used for the model run should be specified. This can be located in the **suewsmodel** directory found as a sub-directory of the **UMEP**-plugin directory. Note that the namelist includes information on the last model run performed.

* Point data

      * - Grid
        - Here, a list of all available modeled grids are listed. Specify one of the grid IDs. If no grid is available, then no data if found in the model output folder.
      * - Year to investigate
        - Specify one of the available years to plot.
      * - Plot basic data
        - Tick this in to plot a summary of the most essential output variables.
      * - Time Period (DOY)
        - Specify the time period to plot.
      * - Variable
        - Specify one of the available variables to plot.
      * - Include another variable
        - Tick this in to add another variable in the plot.
      * - Grid
        - Here, a list of all available modeled grids are listed. Specify one of the grid IDs. If no grid is available, then no data if found in the model output folder.
      * - Variable
        - Specify one of the available variables to plot.
      * - Scatterplot
        - Tick this in to generate a scatterplot between the two variables specified above.
      * - Plot
        - Plot the data selected above

Spatial data

      * - Variable to analyze
        - Select a listed variable to process. If no variable is available, then no data if found in the Model output folder.
      * - Year to investigate
        - Specify one of the available years to plot.
      * - Time Period (DOY)
        - Specify the time period to plot.
      * - Average
        - Tick this in to derive a grid-wise average.
      * - Maximum
        - Tick this in to derive a grid-wise maximum.
      * - Minimum
        - Tick this in to derive a grid-wise minimum.
      * - Median
        - Tick this in to derive a grid-wise median value.
      * - IQR
        - Tick this in to derive a grid-wise interquartile range.
      * - Diurnal
        - Tick this in to include diurnal (all) data.
      * - Daytime
        - Tick this in to include daytime data.
      * - Nightime
        - Tick this in to include nighttime data.
      * - Vector polygon grid used in the SUEWS model
        - Specify the grid that was used to generate the input data to the SUEWS model run of interest.
      * - ID
        - Specify the attribute ID used to generate the input data to the SUEWS model run of interest.
      * - Add result to polygon grid
        - Tick this box to add the results in the attribute table of the grid specified.
      * - Save of GeoTIFF
        - Tick this in to generate a raster grid from the analyze settings specified.
      * - Irregular grid (not squared)
        - Tick this in if a grid is irregular i.e. not squared and aligned north to south.
      * - Pixel resolution (m)
        - When a irregular grid is used, a pixel resolution in meters must be specified.
      * - Output filename
        - Name of the GeoTIFF to be saved.
      * - Add analysis to map canvas
        - All analysis specified above will be added to the map canvas if this box is ticked in.
      * - Generate
        - Starts the spatial processing/analysis.

* Close
    This closes the plugin.
