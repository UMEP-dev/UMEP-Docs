* Introduction:
    The **SOLWEIG Analyzer** plugin can be used to make basic analysis of model results generated by the SOLWEIG plugin.

* Dialog box  :

 Dailog for SOLWEIG Analyser

* Dialog sections  :
.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 90

   * - top
     - Input data is specified
   * - left
     - Plotting of time series derived from Points of Interest during model calculations in SOLWEIG
   * - bottom
     - Analysis of spatial results from model calculations in SOLWEIG

* Load model result:
    The directory where results from a previous model run in SOLWEIG is located.

* Point of Interest data:
.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 0

   * - POIs available
     - Here, a list of all available POI files are listed. Specify one of the POIs. If no variable is available, then no data if found in the Model output folder.
   * - Variable
     - Specify one of the available variables to plot.
   * - Add another POI / variable
     - Tick this in to add another variable in the plot.
   * - Scatterplot
     - Tick this in to generate a scatterplot between the two variables specified above.
   * - Plot
     - Plot the data selected above

* Spatial data  :
.. list-table::

   * - Variable to visualize
     - Select a listed variable to process. If no variable is available, then no data if found in the Model output folder.
   * - Show animation
     - This produces a time-related animation of the selected variable scaled based on the settings to the left in the GUI.
   * - Exclude building pixels
     - Tick this in to exclude building pixels using a building grid generated from the SOLWEIG run. The building grid must have the same extent and pixel resolution as the generated output maps in the model output folder.
   * - Diurnal average
     - Tick this in to include all grids for the selected variable to derive a pixelwise average.
   * - Daytime average
     - Tick this in to include all daytime grids for the selected variable to derive a pixelwise average.
   * - Nightime average
     - Tick this in to include all nighttime grids for the selected variable to derive a pixelwise average.
   * - Maximum
     - Tick this in to get the pixelwise maximum for the selected variable.
   * - Minimum
     - Tick this in to get the pixelwise minimum for the selected variable.
   * - Average of specific time of day
     - The average of the selected time of day for the variable selected is generated. If 'Not Specified' is highlighted, no grid will be generated.
   * - Maximum of specific time of day
     - The maximum of the selected time of day for the variable selected is generated. If 'Not Specified' is highlighted, no grid will be generated.
   * - Minimum of specific time of day
     - The minimum of the selected time of day for the variable selected is generated. If 'Not Specified' is highlighted, no grid will be generated.
   * - T\ :sub:`mrt`: Percent of time above threshold (degC)
     - If T\ :sub:`mrt` is the selected variable, this box become active and calculates the percent of time that T\ :sub:`mrt` for each is above the threshold specified to the right.
   * - T\ :sub:`mrt`: Percent of time below threshold (degC)
     - If T\ :sub:`mrt` is the selected variable, this box become active and calculates the percent of time that T\ :sub:`mrt` for each is below the threshold specified to the right.
   * - Output folder
     - Directory where the results specified above will be saved.
   * - Add analysis to map canvas
     - All analysis specified above will be added to the map canvas if this box is ticked in.
   * - Generate
     - Starts the spatial processing/analysis.

* Close:
    This closes the plugin.
